# :computer: Online-Coding website

online coding web application that facilitates real-time collaboration between mentors and learners.

## Description

The app is a real-time coding platform connecting mentors (like Tom) and learners (such as Josh) in JavaScript sessions. Users choose from curated code blocks, mentors view code in read-only mode, and students code in real-time with Socket technology. Syntax highlighting using Highlight.js enhances the learning experience. Code blocks are manually created supporting various frameworks. The code is available on GitHub for collaboration.
